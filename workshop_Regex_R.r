# What is the difference between the output of the two functions?

# Why are they different?

######################################

# replacing patterns with functions sub and gsub from stringr library

# https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/stringr/vignettes/stringr.html

# str_replace

str_replace (string1, "she","he")
str_replace (string2, "she","he")

# str_replace_all 

str_replace_all (string1, "she","he")
str_replace_all (string2, "she","he")

######################################
# QUESTIONS

# What is the difference between sub (and gsub)and str_replace (str_replace_all)?

# The default order of the arguments is different: 
# 	- in grep, the argument order is string, pattern, replacement
# 	- in str_replace,  the argument order is pattern, replacement, string

# While the native functions sub and gsub return a list of character vectors or a matrix (with simplify argument), 
# the functions from the stringr package always return a character vector.

# When using one or another?

# It is possible that stringr functions have been optimized (though native ones are fast enough, since they built in C),
# but ultimately it depends on which gives you the output you need in an efficient way.

#### Using regular expressions (REGEX) #### 

# excerpt from wikipedia

colonial_expansion = read_lines ("colonial_expansion_excerpt.txt")
colonial_expansion


# grep with regular expression

regex1 = "\\d+" 
# \\d means digits
# + means 1 or more

regex2 = "[[:digit:]]"

grep(regex1,str_split(colonial_expansion," ",simplify=T))
grep(regex1,str_split(colonial_expansion," ",simplify=T),value=T)

grep(regex2,str_split(colonial_expansion," ",simplify=T))
grep(regex2,str_split(colonial_expansion," ",simplify=T),value=T)



######################################
# QUESTIONS

# What is the problem with the output of this text?

# The text must be segmented by space and punctuation must be removed to get a precise result 

######################################

# We will move forward, using the stringr functions and regmatches
# More regular expressions, using 

# The most DANGEROUS and GENERAL regex: . (dot)
# . (dot) matches everything
# * matches any number of times
# .* matches everything, without limitation; that is, matches nothing in particular, unless limited by "?"

sentence = "2 eyes are better than 1, of course!"

regex = ".*"

regmatches (sentence,gregexpr(regex, sentence))

# this part 'gregexpr(regex, sentence)' gives information on the string
gregexpr(regex, sentence)

# AVOID using ".", especially in this combination.

# check this:

# Example 1

regex = "e.*"

regmatches (sentence,gregexpr(regex, sentence))

# Example 2

regex = "2.*1"

regmatches (sentence,gregexpr(regex, sentence))

# More will be shown about this topic when treating parentheses


# Quantifier * MUST be limited with ? , otherwise, the answer will not be correct.

#### More on quantifiers: 
# ? = 0 or 1 time
# + = 1 or more times
# * = any number of times
# {a,b} = matches a to b (1 to 3 numbers, for instance, if a = 1 and b = 3) 

# ? is also a limiter for the * quantifier if it follows *, so you can match what you desire, not too much

numbers = "a123456"

# matches 0 or 1 numbers
regex = "\\d?"

regmatches (numbers,gregexpr(regex,numbers))

# matches 1 or more numbers
regex = "\\d+"

regmatches (numbers,gregexpr(regex,numbers))

# matches any quantity of numbers
regex = "\\d*"

regmatches (numbers,gregexpr(regex,numbers))

# matches 1 to 3 digits
regex = "\\d{1,3}"

regmatches (numbers,gregexpr(regex,numbers))


################################################

# Some of the recommended regex


# new strings

string3 = "She can not see why he is here"
string4 = "she can not see why he is here"

regex = "s?he"
# ? makes characters optional


regex2 = "\\bs?he\\b"
# ? makes characters optional
# \\b marks word limit (by spaces)

# Briefly contrasting grep and regmatches 

grep(regex, string3,value=T)

# matching only the first match with regexpr
regmatches (string3,regexpr(regex,string3))
regmatches (string4,regexpr(regex,string4))

# matching all ocorrences with gregexpr
regmatches (string3,gregexpr(regex2,string3))
regmatches (string4,gregexpr(regex2,string4))

# invert result

regmatches (string4,gregexpr(regex2,string4), invert=TRUE)


# terms between parentheses

# Special charactes like . (dot), parenthesis, quotes and more, must be escaped with \\ (in R) or \ (in other computer languages) to be recognized literaly
# Sometimes, function arguments or options from softwares can make this explicit as well


# new example

kangaroo = "The eastern grey kangaroo (Macropus giganteus) is less well-known than the red (outside Australia)"

regex = "\\(.*\\)"
regex2 = "\\(.*?\\)"

regmatches (kangaroo, gregexpr(regex, kangaroo))
regmatches (kangaroo, gregexpr(regex2, kangaroo))


string5 = "Some of the earliest human remains found in the Americas, Luzia Woman, were found in the area of Pedro Leopoldo, Minas Gerais and provide evidence of human habitation going back at least 11,000 years"

# needed if used grep
#string5_split = strsplit(string5," ")[[1]]

regex = "[[:punct:]]"
# punctuation

#grep(regex,string5_split,value=T)
regmatches (string5,gregexpr(regex,string5))


# matching only the first match with regexpr
regmatches (string4,regexpr("she",string4))

# Lets compare this result with the next regex query

# matching all hits with gregexpr
regex = "s?(he)"
regmatches (string4,gregexpr("s?(he)",string4))
regmatches (string4,gregexpr(regex,string4))

# What was the problem with these results?
# Tip: track in the sentence each match


# Fixing that result delimiting the word boundary with \\b and or \\< and \\>

#regex = "\\bs?(he)\\b" # same as the one below
regex = "\\<s?(he)\\>"

regmatches (string4, gregexpr(regex, string4)) # he or she

# characters

string6 = "Beethoven composed two symphonies during the eight years he lived in the Pasqualati House"
string7 = "Beethoven composed 2 symphonies during the 8 years he lived in the Pasqualati House"

regex = "[a-zA-Z]+"

regmatches (string6, gregexpr(regex, string6))
regmatches (string7, gregexpr(regex, string7))


### Using a library to clean text with regex

removeNumbers(colonial_expansion)
removePunctuation(colonial_expansion)

# And so on

# EXERCISES


new_string = "More information can be sent to my emails redkoala@gmail.com.br or blueWombat@gmail.com until midnight."

# Create a regex to match both email addresses at the same time.

regex_email = "[a-zA-Z]+@gmail\\.com(\\.br)?"

# Test the regex running the following command:

regmatches (new_string,gregexpr(regex_email,new_string))

# ANY SUGGESTIONS OF EXERCISES?

string_test = "YOUR STRING HERE"

regex = "YOUR REGEX HERE"

regmatches (string_test,gregexpr(regex,string_test))

# TIPS

# 1- IF YOU WANT TO QUERY FOR COLUMN NAMES FOLLOWING A CERTAIN PATTERN

# Make a query as usual, but instead of the data, use the column names,
# as in "colnames (data)". Use the cheatsheet or research online if necessary.


# Example 1

# read_csv from readr library, much faster than read.csv, native from R

require(readr)

prokaryotes_sample = read_csv2 ("prokaryotes_sample.csv")
str(prokaryotes_sample)

# converting from tibble to dataframe (unnecessary, but it can be done anytime)
#prokaryotes_sample = data.frame(prokaryotes_sample)
#str(prokaryotes_sample)


# Regex for coccus bacteria

# regex means: Organism or organism, followed by underline(_) or space 
# and any text (no numbers)

regex = "[Oo]rganism[_ ][a-zA-Z]+"
column_names = colnames(prokaryotes_sample)
str(column_names)

organism_columns = regmatches (column_names, gregexpr(regex, column_names))
organism_columns = unlist(organism_columns)
organism_columns

# subseting columns of interest
subset (prokaryotes_sample, select = organism_columns)


# 2 - IF YOU WANT TO QUERY FOR DATA FOLLOWING CERTAIN PATTERNS IN A COLUMN

# First create a subset of the data selecting that column (with the subset function, for instance),
# then query with the regex. Use the cheatsheet or research online if necessary.

# Example 2

# read_csv from readr library, much faster than read.csv, native from R

require(readr)

prokaryotes_sample = read_csv2 ("prokaryotes_sample.csv")
